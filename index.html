                    The Internet Engineering Task Force ("IETF") is madeup of volunteers
                    of network designers, operators, vendors and researchers who work to make
                    the Internet work better. Their focus is on the Internet's architectural
                    design and operation.<br>

                    One of IETF's current intiatives is crearing protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT)
                    to enhance its communication and security. Iot is the connection of physical objects with
                    the Internet to collect, store and share data with other devices anf systems. With more and
                    more things becoming connected to the Internet it is expected that human activity will
                    eventually cease, which is why the IoT standards IETF are working on are so important.

                    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers plays a huge role in
                    the domain names used for websites. ICANN works with the
                     Internet Assigned Numbers Association to help coordinate the unique identifiers
                     computers use to locate one another.

                <p class="icann">
                    Universal Acceptance is currently an intiative ICANN is working on. Universal acceptance would
                    allow all domain names and email addresses the ability to be used across all Internet enabled
                    platforms and devices. When Universal Acceptance is achieved it will "accept, validate, store,
                    process, and display all domain names equally, consistently, and correctly."

                    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) creates protocols and guidelines to help ensure
                    the continued and long term growth of the World Wide Web. W3C's guiding principles are to
                    have Web for All and Web on Everything with "participation, sharing knowledge,
                    and thereby building trust on a global scale."

                    W3C's Web Accessibility Intiative aims to break barriers that make using the web
                    difficult for for individuals with disabilities. This intiative works toward accomodating
                    all disabilities such as visual, cognitive, auditory, speech, etc.. These enhancements
                    would allow disabled individuals to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with and
                    contribute to the web.<br>
